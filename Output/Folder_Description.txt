Image 2: A generalised Cross Validation (GCV) graph to find the optimal smoothing parameter of the data with a harmonic roughness penalty.
Image 3: The smoothed composite visualisation for saturated b-spline basis, and using GCV to find the best harmonic roughness penalty.
Image 4: The first derivative of the raw data.
Image 5: The second derivative of the raw data.
Image 6: The first three principal components of the data, explaining 80% of the variance.
Image 7: (Right) A Leave One Out Cross Validation graph to find the optimal smoothing parameter for the principal components.
